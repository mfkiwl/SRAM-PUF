SRAM-based PUF Authentication and Integrity (SPAI) protocol addresses two significant security goals of SCADA systems. Firstly, it provides continuous integrity validation functionality of the data flow generated by the field sensors. Secondly, the embedded PUF allows remote terminal units (RTUs) to offer robust authentication function, thus, eliminating the rogue sensor devices in SCADA environment.

The SPAI protocol works in three phases, (1) profiling phase, (2) enrollment phase, and (3) authentication phase. We assume a secured and trusted environment on which the profiling and the enrolment phase are executed. The profiling phase identifies the strongest cells in the SRAM, while the enrollment phase generates unique responses for each embedded SRAM-based PUF in all field sensors. The pair of unique challenges and responses are stored into a CRDB at the verifier. In the authentication phase, the verifier selects two random tuples for a given field sensor. If the field sensor regenerates the correct response, the sensor is considered authenticated. To address the security vulnerabilities discussed in section II, our protocol uses timestamps to eliminate replay attacks and keeps track of active requests to avoid DoS attacks.
